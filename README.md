# ARmediaBOX Documentation


The ARmdeiBOX provides Augmented Reality models for media professionals in order to support the visualization of complex facts.

The communication of facts in our modern society often challenges even educated people and numbers, which are supposed to illustrate the magnitude of effects, are getting more and more abstract by their sheer size. AR is one method of visual representation among others, but unlike any other technology, AR places the visuals, e.g. the 3D models, in a real environment. This gives users a more natural reference frame and should help with a deeper understanding of the facts provided.
